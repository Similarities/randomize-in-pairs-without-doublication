# randomize-in-pairs-without-doublication (2 out of X)
for a given list of elements a randomized distribution in pairs by randomized choice in the list's index (and not call by name) and for the constraint of having no double call for the elements // simple stochastics // usefull things 

(compare list.remove(i) with del list[i]).

Hopefully works in python 3.x too ;D !!!
